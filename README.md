Opencomputers program for hbm ntm launch pads managment

The default launch codes are a1b2c3, if you get a message saying that the checksum is invalid, type "rm etc/Launchcodes.txt", and then rerun the program. The launch codes WILL be reset.

This program currently only works with 1 launch pad per computer, I will be updating it eventually...
