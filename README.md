Opencomputers program for hbm ntm launch pads managment
IMPORTANT!!!

MAKE SURE TO ONLY PUT A LONG RANGE DESIGNATOR IN THE LAUNCH PAD OR THIS WILL NOT WORK BEFORE PUTTING IT IN SET ITS TARGET AS ANYWHERE IT WONT MATTER, DO NOT YELL AT ME IF YOU DONT USE A LONG RANGE DESIGNATOR
the default launch codes are a1b2c3.

If you get a message saying that the checksum is invalid, type "rm etc/Launchcodes.txt", and then rerun the program. The launch codes WILL be reset.

have fun
